== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is the plugin sending a list of all installed plugins to UpgradePath? =

After the initial sync during the setup, every day and when you install or update a plugin.

= What meta information are you sending to UpgradePath? =

* Plugin slug
* Version tag

= Does this plugin work if the wordpress instance is not publicly accessible? (f.e. basic auth protected or locally installed) =

The plugin works even then, because UpgradePath is not directly accessing your WordPress instance, your instance is only sending information to UpgradePath.
This is why the WordPress instance only needs internet access.
